  Scenario: sanity
    Given the channel "mychannel" is created and all peers have joined

    # Give the peers some time to gossip their new channel membership
    And we wait 10 seconds

    And "test" chaincode "e2e_cc" is installed from path "github.com/trustbloc/sidetree-fabric/test/chaincode/e2e_cc" to all peers
    And "test" chaincode "e2e_cc" is instantiated from path "github.com/trustbloc/sidetree-fabric/test/chaincode/e2e_cc" on the "mychannel" channel with args "" with endorsement policy "AND('Org1MSP.member','Org2MSP.member')" with collection policy ""

    # Give the peers some time to gossip their installed chaincode
    And we wait 10 seconds

    And chaincode "e2e_cc" is warmed up on all peers on the "mychannel" channel

    # Test transactions
    When client invokes chaincode "e2e_cc" with args "put,k1,20" on the "mychannel" channel
    And we wait 2 seconds
    And client queries chaincode "e2e_cc" with args "get,k1" on a single peer in the "peerorg1" org on the "mychannel" channel
    Then response from "e2e_cc" to client equal value "20"

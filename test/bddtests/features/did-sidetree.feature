  Background: Setup
    Given DCAS collection config "dcas-mychannel" is defined for collection "dcas" as policy="OR('Org1MSP.member','Org2MSP.member')", requiredPeerCount=1, maxPeerCount=2, and timeToLive=60m
    Given DCAS collection config "docs-mychannel" is defined for collection "docs" as policy="OR('Org1MSP.member','Org2MSP.member')", requiredPeerCount=1, maxPeerCount=2, and timeToLive=60m
    Given off-ledger collection config "meta_data_coll" is defined for collection "meta_data" as policy="OR('Org1MSP.member','Org2MSP.member')", requiredPeerCount=0, maxPeerCount=0, and timeToLive=60m

    Given the channel "mychannel" is created and all peers have joined
    And the channel "yourchannel" is created and all peers have joined

    And "system" chaincode "configscc" is instantiated from path "in-process" on the "mychannel" channel with args "" with endorsement policy "AND('Org1MSP.member','Org2MSP.member')" with collection policy ""
    And "system" chaincode "sidetreetxn_cc" is instantiated from path "in-process" on the "mychannel" channel with args "" with endorsement policy "AND('Org1MSP.member','Org2MSP.member')" with collection policy "dcas-mychannel"

  @invalid_config_update
  Scenario: Invalid configuration
    Given fabric-cli context "mychannel" is used
    When fabric-cli is executed with args "ledgerconfig update --configfile ./fixtures/config/fabric/invalid-protocol-config.json --noprompt" then the error response should contain "algorithm not supported"
